## 📌 Summary
This project investigates an intelligent ground-penetrating radar (GPR) system for estimating root-zone soil moisture—crucial for precision agriculture. Using gprMax, we generate a large-scale synthetic dataset based on a 1.5 GHz Ricker waveform in a realistic three-layer soil horizon. Feature engineering and model selection are applied to extract meaningful components and identify the most accurate machine learning model for moisture prediction. The model is validated using real GPR data collected at the SoilX lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

Our intelligent GPR system, drone-coupled, enables high-resolution (10 m horizontal, 1.5 cm vertical) and deep penetration (beyond 2 m) for creating 3D root-zone moisture maps—outperforming traditional methods like satellite imaging.

## 🌱 Application
Supports efficient irrigation and sustainable agriculture practices in mega farms.
